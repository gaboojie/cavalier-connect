# 'Cavalier Connect' - A UVA Event Management Application
*This project has been deprecated as it was made for a semester-long project that has ended. I'm keeping this on my GitHub page as a means of showing my experience in web development.*

This repository contains a semester-long UVA project for CS 3240: Software Engineering.
In this project, my team and I built a full-stack website that allows UVA students to create, join, and host events at UVA.
It included features such as: SMS/Email notifications, event searching, a calendar view of upcoming
events, organizations (grouping of users), recurring events, event photos, comment sections, 
friends, Google accounts, etc.

To create this project, our team used the following technologies:
1. Heroku - Deployment 
2. PostgreSQL - Database management
3. Google Auth - User authentication
4. GitHub CI - Continuous integration support
5. Django (Python web-framework) - Frontend/backend framework
6. Amazon Web Services - To store users' files (i.e: .png, .txt, .pdf)

By: Gabriel Jackson and 4 other students at UVA (identities hidden).
